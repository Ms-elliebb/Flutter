# Flutter Projects Repository

This repository hosts my mobile application projects developed using the Flutter framework and Dart language. You can explore various cross-platform apps, UI experiments, and reusable components built for both Android and iOS.

## Planned Projects

### 1. Real-time Whiteboard
*   **Concept:** A collaborative whiteboard application.
*   **Features:**
    *   Real-time drawing synchronization using Firebase RTDB/Firestore.
    *   Drawing capabilities implemented with `CustomPaint`.
    *   Basic room creation and joining functionality.

### 2. IoT Control Panel (Simulated Data)
*   **Concept:** A dashboard to monitor and potentially control IoT devices (using simulated data).
*   **Features:**
    *   Display simulated sensor data.
    *   Data visualization using charts (e.g., with `fl_chart`).
    *   Modern and responsive user interface.

### 3. Gamified Quiz App
*   **Concept:** A quiz application with gamification elements.

    *   Topic-specific quizzes.
    *   Progress tracking stored locally (`hive`/`shared_preferences`) or on Firebase.
    *   Smooth animations and engaging user experience.

*Note: The `.gitkeep` file in the root is a placeholder to ensure the main directory is tracked by Git, even when initially empty.*
